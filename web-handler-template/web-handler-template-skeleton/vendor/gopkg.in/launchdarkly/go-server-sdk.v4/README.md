===========================

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk)

LaunchDarkly overview
-------------------------
[LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) is a feature management platform that serves over 100 billion feature flags daily to help teams build better software, faster. [Get started](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/getting-started) using LaunchDarkly today!
 
Supported Go versions
-------------------------

This version of the LaunchDarkly SDK has been tested with Go 1.8 through 1.14.

Getting started
-----------

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/go-sdk-reference#section-getting-started) for instructions on getting started with using the SDK.

HTTPS proxy
------------
Go's standard HTTP library provides built-in support for the use of an HTTPS proxy. If the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable is present then the SDK will proxy all network requests through the URL provided.

How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Mac/Linux systems:
```
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```


How to set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable on Windows systems:
```
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```


If your proxy requires authentication then you can prefix the URN with your login information:
```
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```
or
```
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@web-proxy.domain.com:8080
```


Database integrations
---------------------

Feature flag data can be kept in a persistent store using Redis, Consul, or DynamoDB. These adapters are implemented in the subpackages `redis`, `ldconsul`, and `lddynamodb`; to use them, call the `New...FeatureStore` function provided by the subpackage, and put the returned object in the `FeatureStore` field of your client configuration. See the subpackages and the [SDK reference guide](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/using-a-persistent-feature-store) for more information.

-----------

Check out our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/go-sdk-reference).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

Contributing
------------

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs) for a complete list.
